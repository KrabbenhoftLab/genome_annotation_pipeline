HISAT_THREADS=10 # [S4] how many threads for HISAT2
HISAT_RAM="400G" # [S4] how much RAM for HISAT2
## IMPORTANT NOTE: RNA-seq files should not be more than a few Gb in size, otherwise HISAT2 will probably fail (likely error 137, insufficient RAM)

############### NCBI download options #######################
## NCBI_TARGET_GENOMES contains the full path to two column tab delimited text file
## first colum is the GenBank or RefSeq ID
## you can find that information here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/
## second column is a unique name for that species/genome, keep it short, only alphanumeric characters
NCBI_TARGET_GENOMES="/projects/academic/tkrabben/MacGuigan/genome_annotations/Lpel/genomes_to_download.txt" # [S5]
NCBI_DOWNLOAD_DIR="NCBI_genomes" # [S5] directory for your downloaded files, will be created within ANNOTATION_DIR_CLUSTER

BRAKER_THREADS=20 # [S6]
BRAKER_RAM="400G" # [S6]
## PROT_FASTA is the path to a concatenated FASTA file containing all protein evidence
## IMPORTANT: the PROT_FASTA path must nested within ANNOTATION_DIR_CLUSTER
##### For example, if ANNOTATION_DIR_CLUSTER = "/path/to/my/annot/dir" 
##### and the full path to your protein FASTA is "/path/to/my/annot/dir/proteins/myData.fasta"
##### then PROT_FASTA = "proteins/myData.fasta"
## you will likely want to include protein data from NCBI for closely related species (see STEP 5 of this pipeline)
## you may also want to include the OrthoDB database
## clade-specific OrthoDB V11 databases available here: https://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/partitioned_odb11/
## to concatenate FASTA files, simply run "cat file1.fasta file2.fasta file3.fasta > concatenated.fasta"
## note: you can also concatenate gzipped fasta files using "cat" (but all fasta files must be gzipped)
PROT_FASTA="protein_data/orthodb.metazoa.ncbiRefSeq.fasta" # [S6]

GEMOMA_FILTER_ONLY="no" # [S7,8] filter previous GeMoMa run without redoing the full annotation (yes or no)?
## GEMOMA_REFS is the full path to a directory containing GFF and genome FASTA files for reference species
## files must end in .gff or .fasta

## file prefixes must be comprised only of letters and numbers, no special characters
## if you ran STEP 5 of this pipeline, GEMOMA_REFS can be the same directory as NCBI_DOWNLOAD_DIR
GEMOMA_REFS="/projects/academic/tkrabben/MacGuigan/genome_annotations/Lpel/GeMoMa_refs" # [S7]
## following options are for using RNA-seq data with GeMoMa
USE_HISAT2_RNA_SEQ=YES # [S7] do you want to use the RNA-seq mapping generated by HISAT2 in STEP 4, YES or NO?
## HISAT2_RNA_LIB_TYPE is the RNA-seq library type(FR_UNSTRANDED, FR_FIRST_STRAND, or FR_SECOND_STRAND)
## usually RNA-seq libraries are unstranded, but worth double checking for your datasets
HISAT2_RNA_LIB_TYPE="FR_UNSTRANDED"
## following options allow GeMoMa to use mapped RNA-seq reads not produced by STEP 4
## these "custom" mapped reads can be used alone or in combination with the mapped RNA-seq data from STEP 4
